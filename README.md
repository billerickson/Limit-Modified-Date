# [Limit Modified Date]

Make minor changes to your content without changing the last modified date

When "Don't update the modified date" is checked, saving content does not update the post modified date ( `get_the_modified_date()` ). When making a large content change, you can uncheck it before saving the post and the modified date will be updated.

This plugin works with both the Gutenberg block editor and the Classic editor.

## Customization ##

This plugin only applies to the `post` post type by default. You can customize which post types it appears on using the `limit_modified_date_post_types` filter.
